    <h1>
        Hey Pastor Jane 😁
    </h1>
    <p>
        Sometimes I look back at my life and wonder how I made it through certain moments… and then I remember that God sent me people like you. People who don’t just pass through your life, but leave <span class="highlight">fingerprints on your heart.</span> 
        And you, more than anyone, have left a mark that time can never erase. It’s still unbelievable to me that we’ve only known each other for two years. Two small years yet it feels like our connection was written long before we ever met. It feels like my soul recognized you instantly, like we were never strangers. What we have doesn’t feel new… <span class="highlight">it feels destined. Familiar. Almost divine.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        You’ve been more than a sister to me — you’ve been a blessing, a lifeline, and a living reminder that God still sends people with pure hearts. People who care deeply, quietly, genuinely.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you for every moment you listened to my problems, even when I didn’t have the right words, even when all I had were pieces of thoughts and heavy feelings. You didn’t just hear me — <span class="highlight">you understood me.</span> And that kind of understanding is rare.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you for noticing when I wasn’t okay, even when I tried to hide it behind a smile or short messages. The way you’d ask, “What’s wrong?” or “Are you okay?” with that gentle concern… it mattered. You have no idea how many days you saved by simply caring enough to notice my silence. <span class="highlight">Sometimes your voice alone brought peace into storms I didn’t know how to calm.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        You’ve encouraged me when my spirit felt tired.
        You’ve lifted me when life felt too heavy.
        <span class="highlight">You’ve believed in me when I struggled to believe in myself.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        There is something sacred about the way you’ve supported me — not from obligation, not from convenience, but from a place of genuine love, kindness, and compassion. That is the kind of support that changes a person. <span class="highlight">That is the kind of presence that heals.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        These two years with you have shown me that family isn’t always blood — sometimes it’s the people God places in your path at the exact moment you need them. And you have been that person for me in ways words can barely capture.
    </p>

    <ul class="qualities-list">
        <li>I appreciate your patience.</li>
        <li>I appreciate your honesty.</li>
        <li>I appreciate your wisdom.</li>
        <li>I appreciate your heart.</li>
        <li>I appreciate your strength.</li>
        <li>I appreciate your kindness.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        And most of all, I appreciate the way you’ve stood with me <span class="highlight">gently, consistently, faithfully</span> — through days when I was shining and through days when I was falling apart.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I pray that God surrounds you with the same love you’ve poured into me. I pray that He opens doors for you, protects your heart, and rewards everything you’ve done for me — both the things I thanked you for and the things I didn’t even notice.
    </p>

    <div class="closing">
        <p>
            Two years… yet it feels like a lifetime of love, loyalty, and genuine connection.
            <br>And I thank God for every moment you’ve walked beside me.
        </p>
